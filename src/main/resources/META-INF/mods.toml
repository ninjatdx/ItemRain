Item Rain is a mod that re-creates the mod used on the Item Rain video series from Slogoman, Jelly and Crainer, which as all mods they use, didn't got released for the public to play.
I have no intention on claiming any rights for this idea. I just think that it is a pretty good context for a mod and I'm sure there are people wanting a mod like this.
